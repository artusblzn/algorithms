# Algorithms and Data Structures
This repository aggregates mainly algorithm and data structures implementations.

## Repository structure
There's two main folders:
1. Problems
2. Algorithms and Data Structures

The first one is the solving of algorithmic problems.
The second one is the pure implementation of classic algorithms and data structures.

In every implementation I'll try to explain the main idea behind it.
